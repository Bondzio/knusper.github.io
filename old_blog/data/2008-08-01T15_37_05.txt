Installiert - getestet und keine Bugs mehr gefunden...

Changelog:

   1. Corrects a bug with strget() not properly returning EOF because it was
   returning a char or unsigned int instead of an int (should be a signed int,
   but that way lies C99 madness.) This bug was reported by A.S.Bradbury, who
   discovered it when trying to build markdown with a 64 bit version of gcc.
   2. Corrects a boundary condition bug with '![]()' and/or '[]()', where the
   content parser stops parsing 4 (for IMG) or 5 (for HTML) characters before
   the end of the embedded content. This bug was reported by Christian Herenz,
   who has been finding many many boundary condition bugs in the way '![]()' and
   []() (don’t) work.
   3. The new configuration option --enable-superscript turns on fancypants
   substitutions that translate word^word into word<sup>word</sup>. I'm not
   sure if it’s the most useful thing in the world, but I have found cases
   where I'd like to be able to get superscripts generated just by
   themselves. (and since I don’t code in PASCAL any more, I don’t need to
   worry about tripping over a dereferencing ^ as much as I used to worry
   about it.)

Punkt 2 gefällt mir besonders gut ;)
