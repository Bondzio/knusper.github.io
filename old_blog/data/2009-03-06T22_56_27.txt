 *The basic idea of cloaking is a device that guides incoming light
around an interior region such that the light emerges as if it had
propagated through empty space; any object in the interior region is
thereby rendered invisible. In a paper appearing in Physical Review
Letters, Yun Lai and colleagues at the Hong Kong University of
Science and Technology present a theoretical design for cloaking that
is far less intuitive than this simple picture. In their design,
the object to be hidden is placed at a specific position in the
vicinity of a new type of cloaking device that is tailor-made for the
object.*

Das haben die Klingonen doch schon lange... ;-)
