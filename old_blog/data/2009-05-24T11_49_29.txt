Podcasts I like:

[A Deeper Groove](http://adeepergroove.podbean.com/) *deep house, broken beat, nu jazz, hip hop, soul, reggae, latin and interplanetary sounds.*

[LaksFM Podcast](http://feeds.feedburner.com/laksfm) *More Info at RobotsForRobots.net: [Link](http://feeds.feedburner.com/laksfm)*

[Deeplove.ch Podacst](http://www.deeplove.ch/podcast/) *there's a deep love in all of us.. the right claim to show the passion to the music from our label honcho Marco Berto. enjoy the weekly episodes of Marco Berto and his guests.* And suddenly all playlists got eaten by the dog :-)

[HomeCookinMixes.com](http://www.homecookinmixes.com/) *
HomeCookin' is about: vinyl, old grooves, new beats, diggin' crates and mixing it all up.*
